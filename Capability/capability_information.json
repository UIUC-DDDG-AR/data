The template is created by use of measurements, distance between eye, width of nose, length of jaw line. Moreover, it can work by extracting landmarks such as a nose or eyes. In general, there are two approaches, geometric (shapes) or photometric (pixels). 3D facial recognition is not affected by lighting. Common applications include photo tagging, security, social media filters, and etc. One note is that for biometrics, it is less accurate than iris or fingerprint recognition."
